# QMFreeze



## Introduction

QMFreeze is a quality of life mod that prevents the user from being unable to interact with their Quick Menu in VR while falling.

## Prerequisites

Before using QMFreeze, make sure you have the following:

- [Lemon Loader]([https://lemonloader.github.io/](https://github.com/LemonLoader/MelonLoader/releases/tag/0.1.1)) installed on your Quest 2 device.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of QMFreeze from the [Releases](https://github.com/EdenFails/QMFreeze/releases) page.
2. Copy the downloaded `.dll` file into your Quest 2's mod folder (`/sdcard/Android/data/com.vrchat.oculus.quest/files/Mods`).

## Usage

QMFreeze doesn't have a user interface or any configuration options. It is always active when placed in the mods folder. Simply launch your game, and QMFreeze will automatically freeze you when opening the Quick Menu.
